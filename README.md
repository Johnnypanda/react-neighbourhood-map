# React neighborhood map (Udacity FEND project)

Project Overview
I developed a single page application featuring a map of my neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. I added functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

Why this Project?
The neighborhood map application is complex enough and incorporates a variety of data points that it can easily become unwieldy to manage. There are a number of frameworks, libraries and APIs available to make this process more manageable and many employers are looking for specific skills in using these packages.

What will I Learned?
I learned how to use google maps API and implement them in react projects.
